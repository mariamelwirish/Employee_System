An application of object-oriented programming using python in an employment system that allows the user to:
1. Add new employee.
   > The user can _**add**_ employees & their information (_age & salary_).

   > The user can **_view_** all the employees with all their details. If no employees registered, it displays _"No employees at the moment!"_
3. Delete by age.
   > The user can **_delete_** employees based on the **_age range_** by entering the boudries of the range, and all the employees within the range will be deleted.
4. Update salary by name.
   > Typing the employee's _**name**_ in the application, the user can **_update his salary_**. 
5. End the program.
   > If the user chose 5, the program _**terminates**_.
